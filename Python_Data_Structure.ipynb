        "  - hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides fast data retrieval based on keys. It achieves this efficiency by using a hash function to compute an index for each key, which determines where the value is stored in an underlying array\n",

        "\n",
        "   When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, Python computes the hash value of the key using a hash function.\n",

        "    Immutability\n",

        "    Efficiency\n",

        "    Clear Intent\n",
        "    \n",

        "  - In Python, sets automatically handle duplicate values by eliminating duplicates. When you try to add an item to a set, if that item is already present, the set simply ignores the addition and keeps only one instance of that item.

        "   Using in with Dictionaries\n",
        "   \n",
        "   When you use the in keyword with a dictionary, it checks for the presence of a key in the dictionary, not the value. If you want to check for a key, it will return True if the key exists in the dictionary's keys. This operation is constant time (O(1)) because dictionaries are implemented using a hash table, allowing for efficient key lookups.\n",

        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not\n",
        "  - No, we cannot modify the elements of a tuple after it is created. This is because tuples are immutable in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why Tuples Are Immutable:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Immutability means that once a tuple is created, you cannot change its content. This applies to both the elements inside the tuple and its overall structure (such as adding or removing elements).\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The reason for this is to ensure data integrity and to provide certain performance and security benefits. Immutable objects, like tuples, are easier to optimize and can be safely shared between different parts of a program without the risk of being altered unintentionally.\n",

        "  When Can You Modify a Tuple?\n",

        "  - A nested dictionary is a dictionary in Python where one or more of its values are themselves dictionaries. Essentially, it's a dictionary whose values can contain other dictionaries as values. Nested dictionaries allow you to represent complex, hierarchical data structures, such as those used to represent records, configurations, or relationships between entities.\n",

        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary ?\n",

        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries ?\n",
        "  - In Python, lists and dictionaries are both versatile data structures, but they are used in different situations based on the requirements of your program. Lists are generally preferred over dictionaries in certain scenarios due to their characteristics and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "   When the Data is Ordered:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Lists maintain the order of insertion. If you need to preserve the sequence of elements or access them by their position (index), lists are the natural choice.\n",

        "  When You Need to Store Multiple Values of the Same Type:\n",

        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval ?\n",
        "  - Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because the order in which key-value pairs are stored in the dictionary is not guaranteed.
